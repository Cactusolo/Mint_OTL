**********************************************************************  
Decide to remove "Salvia_carnea_var._punicans" and restart query open tree, so everything should be the same, except "Salvia_carnea_var._punicans" excluded, and the tree has 5213 species  
*************************************************************************  
Adding one more species "Salvia_carnea_var._punicans" based on file Salvia_carnea_var._punicans.csv  

so now the most updated mint tree is "OPT_Mint_speciesname_BR_5214tip_Oct162018.tre" with 5214 tip on the tree.

### History note (Oct082018):  

In the "MRCA_183.csv", we found "Salvia_carnea" has a duplicate position, so remove:
Salvia_carnea,Salvia_tortuosa,Salvia_purpurea  

Then, the number of the "MRCA_183.csv" file became 182, and rename the file as "MRCA_182.csv"   

and updated the tree:  

 5031 + 182 = 5213 tips  

This tree will only containing part of species from the weird clade
the rest 395 species from the weird clade, we don't have further info to position it on the tree
